# LiveSvelteSsrBench

This repository helps visualise where time is spent when serving a request using [live_svelte](https://github.com/woutdp/live_svelte). It leverages [eFlamb√®](https://github.com/Stratus3D/eflambe) to generate flamegraphs. This is inspired by [elixir_1brc](https://github.com/rajrajhans/elixir_1brc).

## Generating Flamegraphs

Start by launching the server with IEx:

```bash
MIX_ENV=prod mix assets.deploy
MIX_ENV=prod iex -S mix phx.server
```

Next, specify the function you want to capture (e.g. an entire request):

```elixir
:eflambe.capture({Bandit.Pipeline, :run, 4}, 1, [])
```

Now, visit http://localhost:4000 in your browser. A `.bggg` file will be generated in the root directory. You can visualise it using [Speedscope](https://www.speedscope.app).

### Notes

Only function calls within a single process are captured. If another process is called (e.g. using `GenServer.call/2`), the captured graph will show a sleep section while the calling process is waiting.

To gain a more comprehensive understanding, you can capture the function of the called process separately.

```elixir
:eflambe.capture({NodeJS.Worker, :handle_call, 3}, 1, [])
```

Then, visit http://localhost:4000 again to generate a new trace.
